# CLIJ2
This repository contains the successor of [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io). 

Right now, this is very preliminary.

## Installation intructions
Download Fiji and activate the `clij` update site as described [here](https://clij.github.io/clij-docs/installationInFiji). 
Furthermore, activate another update site `clij2`.
Update Fiji and restart it.

## CLIJ2 reference
The current API reference of CLIJ2 is available 
[here](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference). 
Please note that both: The CLIJ2 gateway and the API are under heavy construction and can change at any point. 
See the [release notes](https://github.com/clij/clij2/releases) in case one of your experimental workflows breaks.

## Code examples
Have a look in the [macros](https://github.com/clij/clij2-docs/tree/master/src/main/macro) folder.

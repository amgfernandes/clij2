# CLIJ advanced filters (under construction)
This repository contains experimental / advanced filters based on [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io). 
Methods which turn out to be useful will become part of CLIJ 2.0.

Right now, this is very preliminary.

## Installation intructions
Download Fiji and activate the `clij` update site as described [here](https://clij.github.io/clij-docs/installationInFiji). 
Download [clij-advanced-filters_.jar](https://github.com/clij/clij-advanced-filters/releases/download/0.6.0-preprint_v2/clij-advanced-filters_-0.6.0.jar) and copy it to the `plugins` directory of your Fiji installation. Restart Fiji.

## CLIJ2 reference
The current API reference of CLIJ2 is available [here](reference). Please note that both: The CLIJ2 gateway and the API are under heavy construction and can change at any point.

## Code examples
Have a look in the [macros](https://github.com/clij/clij-advanced-filters/tree/master/src/main/macro) folder.
